By evaluating this function you may change some default settings of the <br>
system. The function should not be connected to other functions. Note that you <br>
need to evaluate this function every time you restart OM or after you <br>
change a setting to change the preferences.<br>
<br>
&lt;backjump?&gt;     Backjumping speeds up backtracking by jumping <br>
directly to the variable that caused a failed ruletest instead of <br>
step-by-step backtracking. The speed difference vary from no <br>
difference to a huge difference. The way backjumping is used in this <br>
system, it should not cause the system to miss possible solutions. It <br>
is strongly recommended to keep backjumping on.<br>
<br>
&lt;max-nr-of-loops&gt; is the maximum search loops the engine will do before stopping. <br>
---<br>
<br>
The following variables sets what engine a failed rule prefers to<br>
backtrack. If the prefered engine cannot be backtracked, the system<br>
will make another choice based on lower priorities. Note that if<br>
more than one rule fails, the choice will be based on the most<br>
frequently proposed engine to backtrack. <br>
<br>
The default settings can be found by opening a new preference function.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-rp1v&gt;  r-rhyth-pitch-one-vocie<br>
 - self (default): backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) where the failed variable was found.<br>
 - other: backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) that is associated with the enginewhere the failed variable was found.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-rr2v&gt; r-rhythm-rhythm<br>
 - self: backtrack the engine (voice 1 or 2) where the failed varialbe was found.<br>
 - other (default): backtrack the engine (voice 1 or 2) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-rh2v&gt; r-rhythm-hierarchy<br>
 - self: backtrack the engine (voice 1 or 2) where the failed variable was found.<br>
 - other (default): backtrack the engine (voice 1 or 2) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-rmh2v&gt; r-metric-hierarchy<br>
 - rhythm (default): backtrack the rhythm engine<br>
 - meter: backtrack the metric engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-dm1v&gt; r-note-meter if pitch information is NOT asked for<br>
 - rhythm (default): backtrack the rhythm engine<br>
 - meter: backtrack the metric engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-nm1v&gt; r-note-meter if pitch information is asked for<br>
 - self (default): backtrack the engine (rhythm, pitch or meter) where the failed variable was found.<br>
 - rhythm/pitch: backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found. The metric engine always prefer to backtrack the rhythm engine.<br>
 - pitch/rhythm: backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found. The metric engine always prefer to backtrack the pitch engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-md1v&gt; r-meter-note if pitch information is NOT asked for<br>
 - rhythm (default): backtrack the rhythm engine<br>
 - meter: backtrack the metric engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-mn1v&gt; r-meter-note if pitch information is asked for<br>
 - self (default): backtrack the engine (rhythm, pitch or meter) where the failed variable was found.<br>
 - rhythm/pitch: backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found. The metric engine always prefer to backtrack the rhythm engine.<br>
 - pitch/rhythm: backtrack the engine (rhythm or pitch) that is associated with the engine where the failed variable was found. The metric engine always prefer to backtrack the pitch engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-ppnv&gt; r-pitch-pitch<br>
 - next-pitch (default): backtrack the pitch engine after the engine where the failed variable was found (the order is defined by the voice input).<br>
 - next-rhythm: backtrack the pitch engine after the engine where the failed variable was found (the order is defined by the voice input).<br>
 - current-pitch: if the failed variable is in a pitch engine, backtrack the same engine. If it is in a rhythm engine, backtrack the associated pitch engine.<br>
 - current-rhythm: if the failed variable is in a rhythm engine, backtrack the same engine. If it is in a pitch engine, backtrack the associated rhythm engine.<br>
<br>
&lt;bktr-leNv&gt; r-list-all-events<br>
 - next:  backtrack the engine after the engine where the failed variable was found (the order is defined by the voice input).<br>
 - self:  backtrack the engine where the failed variable was found.<br>
