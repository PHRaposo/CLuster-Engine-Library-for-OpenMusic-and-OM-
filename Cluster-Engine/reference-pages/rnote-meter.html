<br><font color=882222><b>Description:</b></font><p>
Rule for the metric position of notes and rests. The rule checks all <br>
events in one voice.<br>
<br>
&lt;rule&gt; is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the <br>
function has to be either true or false. Each input will receive the <br>
information on regarding an events offset to its beat or the first beat of <br>
its measure. If the rule has more than one input it will receive information <br>
for consecutive events. The exact information and format of an input depends <br>
on settings (see below).<br>
<br>
&lt;voices&gt; is the number for the voice (starting at 0) that the rule <br>
affects. A list of numbers indicate that the rule is valid for every<br>
voice in the list.<br>
<br>
&lt;format&gt; sets how the information for an input is formated. <br>
 - offs:       An input will receive the offset to the following beat <br>
               (i.e. the duration until the following beat). Offset 0 <br>
               indicates that the event is synchronized with the beat.<br>
               If the duration of an event is not necessary to know, this<br>
               setting should be chosen.<br>
 - d_offs:     An input will receive a list with the duration of the <br>
               event and the offset to the following beat (i.e. the duration <br>
               until the following beat). Offset 0 indicates that the event<br>
               is synchronized with the beat. Example: '(1/4 -1/8)<br>
 - d_offs_m:   An input will receive a list with the duration of the <br>
               event, the offset to the following beat (i.e. the duration <br>
               until the following beat) and the time signature. <br>
               The time signature is given for the measure where the events<br>
               onset exist (it may be sustained into another measure). <br>
               ONLY ISE THIS SETTING IF YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TIME SIGNATURE.<br>
               Example: '(1/4 -1/8 (3 4))<br>
 - d_offs_m_n: An input will receive a list with the duration of the <br>
               event, the offset to the following beat (i.e. the duration <br>
               until the following beat), the time signature and the pitch. <br>
               The time signature is given for the measure where the events<br>
               onset exist (it may be sustained into another measure). <br>
               ONLY ISE THIS SETTING IF YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PITCH.<br>
               Example: '(1/4 -1/8 (3 4) 60)<br>
<br>
&lt;metric-structure&gt; <br>
 - beats: The offsets will relate to the following beat.<br>
 - 1st-beat:  The offset will relate to the following 1st beat in the <br>
              next measure.<br>
<br>
&lt;rest-mode&gt;<br>
 - incl.rests: The rule will be checked for durations and rests (rests are<br>
              indicated as negative durations). If rests are not included<br>
              in the domain, this setting should be chosen.<br>
 - durations: The rule will not be checked for rests (if the rule has<br>
              more than one input, rests will be skipped).<br>
<br>
*** NOT SUPPORTED **********************************<br>
&lt;gracenotes?&gt; <br>
 - normal:    The rule will include grace notes as separate events. If<br>
              grace notes are not included in the domain, this setting <br>
              should be chosen.<br>
 - exclude-gracenotes: The rule will not be checkes for grace notes (if <br>
              the rule has more than one input, grace notes will be <br>
              skipped).<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
Efficiency: The most efficient setting is &lt;offs&gt;, &lt;incl.rests&gt;, since<br>
it the rule can assume that an offset always is a new onset and it can <br>
check the rule before the next event is assigned. Least efficient is the<br>
&lt;d_offs_m&gt; setting, since the rule cannot be checked until the time <br>
signature is known for a metric point. <br>
<br>
Optional inputs:<br>
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch <br>
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that <br>
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule <br>
is true, the weight (given in the &lt;weight&gt; input) is passed to the engine. <br>
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a <br>
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false <br>
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it <br>
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the <br>
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the <br>
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. <br>
<br>
Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the <br>
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending<br>
on the candidate).<br>
