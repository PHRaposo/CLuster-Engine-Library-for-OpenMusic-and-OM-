<br><font color=882222><b>Description:</b></font><p>
Heuristic rule for the relation between durations in two voices. <br>
<br>
Heuristic rules sort the candidates locally according to weights. <br>
The true/false rules will test candidates that receive high weights by<br>
the heuristic rules before other candidates (and in this way give them<br>
higher priority). A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor <br>
can it trigger backtracking of an engine. <br>
<br>
NOTE that this heuristic rule will have most effect on durations: offsets<br>
will be very little affected (if any at all).<br>
<br>
&lt;rule&gt; is a function that outputs a numerical weight. Each input will <br>
receive a list with information regarding a timepoint in the score. If the <br>
rule has more than one input it will receive information for consecutive <br>
timepoints. If the input-mode2 is set to list, the rule can only have one <br>
input. The exact information and format of the list depends on the <br>
selected input mode (see below).<br>
<br>
&lt;voice1&gt; and &lt;voice2&gt; are the numbers for the voices (starting at 0) that <br>
the rule affects. <br>
<br>
&lt;input-mode1&gt; determines what format for the variables:<br>
 - d1_offset: The rule will receive a list with a duration in voice 1 and <br>
              the offset to the event in voice 2 that exist at the onset <br>
              for the duration in voice 1. Rests and grace notes in voice 1 <br>
              are ignored. Grace notes are ignored in voice 2, but rests are<br>
              included. Format: '(duration offset), example: '(1/2 -1/8).<br>
 - d1_offset_d2: Identical to d1_offset but also returns the duration (or <br>
              rest) in voice 2. Format: '(duration1 offset duration2), <br>
              example: '(1/2 -1/8 1/4).<br>
<br>
&lt;input-mode2&gt;<br>
 - norm: This setting is the normal behaviour of the function. An input receives<br>
              the information for one time point. More than one input it <br>
              will receive information for consecutive timepoints.<br>
 - list: The rule must have exactly one input. The input will receive a <br>
              list of all time points that are known when the rule is<br>
              checked. If any of the break-at-rest settings are used, the<br>
              rule will check each segment at a time.<br>
<br>
&lt;input-filter&gt; determines what information the rule will receive:<br>
 - at-durations-v1: The rule will receive informaton for all durations  <br>
              (grace notes and rests excluded) in voice 1.<br>
 - break-at-rest-v1: This will only differ from the above setting for<br>
              rules with more than one input. The rule will not not<br>
              check durations that are separated by a rest in voice 1.<br>
              If the list setting is chosen above, the list will be<br>
              segmented at rests in voice 1.<br>
 - break-at-rest-v1-v2: The rule will not check points where voice 1 or<br>
              voice 2 (or both) have a rest. If the rule has more than <br>
              one input, it will not check timepoints that are separated <br>
              by a rest in voice 1 or timepoints that have rests in voice 2.<br>
              If the list setting is chosen above, the list will be<br>
              segmented at rests in voice 1 or 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
The latter 2 settings are useful for rules that are only valid within <br>
a phrase.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Backtracking: By default this rule will trigger backtracking in the other<br>
               engine than the engine that failed. If this is not possible, <br>
               it will trigger backtracking in its own engine.]<br>
<br>
A word on efficiency:<br>
The most efficient input mode is the d1_offset (if the input-filter is set<br>
to at-durations-v1): the system is able to check this type of rule earlier than <br>
rules with other input modes. This is due to that it can consider the last endpoint<br>
as a new onset, without knowing the duration for this new event. This setting<br>
will have more of an impact than other settings. Other input modes will only have<br>
an effect for durations (not offsets).<br>
