<br><font color=882222><b>Description:</b></font><p>
&lt;rule&gt; is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the <br>
function has to be either true or false. If there are more than one <br>
input to the function, they will receive consecutive pitches (or <br>
consecutive motifs depending on the input-mode). <br>
<br>
&lt;voices&gt; is the number for the voice (starting at 0) that the rule affects. <br>
It is possible to give a list of several voice numbers: The rule will then <br>
be applied to every voice in the list (independant of each other).<br>
<br>
&lt;input-mode&gt; determines what type of variables the rule will receive in <br>
its inputs:<br>
 - pitches: The rule will receive individual  pitches, one for each input.<br>
 - pitch/nth: As above, but the position of the pitch is also indicated.<br>
              Format: '(pitch nth) Ex. '(60 3).<br>
 - motifs: The rule will receive (consecutive) motifs, one motif for each <br>
           input. A motif is a collection of pitches that are grouped in <br>
           a list. Motifs are designed in the domain and cannot be redesigned<br>
           by the engine. Note that a motif may be a single pitch (a list <br>
           with one MIDI note number) if it is defined as such in the domain.<br>
 - motif/nth: As above, but the position of the pitches is also indicated.<br>
              Format: '((pitch-motif) (nth-list)) Ex. '((60 64) (3 4)).<br>
 - motif/index: As motifs, but the index of the variable is also indicated.<br>
                Format: '((pitch-motif) index) Ex. '((60 64) 2).<br>
 - all-pitches: All pitches in the voice that are assigned at the time the  <br>
                rule is checked are given as a list of MIDI note numbers.  <br>
                The list will thus become longer and longer during the <br>
                search. The rule can only have ONE input in this mode.<br>
<br>
[Backtracking: This rule will trigger backtracking in its own engine.]<br>
<br>
Optional inputs:<br>
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch <br>
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that <br>
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule <br>
is true, the weight (given in the &lt;weight&gt; input) is passed to the engine. <br>
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a <br>
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false <br>
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it <br>
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the <br>
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the <br>
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. <br>
<br>
Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the <br>
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending<br>
on the candidate).<br>
