Rule for rhythm-pitch pairs in one voice. <br>
<br>
&lt;rule&gt; is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the <br>
function has to be either true or false. Each input will receive a list <br>
with a duration-pitch pair, one list for each input (for example '(1/4 60)). <br>
Rests will have the pitch nil indicated (for example '(-1/8 nil)).If there <br>
is more than one input to the function, they will receive consecutive <br>
rhythm-pitch pairs.<br>
<br>
&lt;voices&gt; is the number for the voice (starting at 0) that the rule affects. <br>
It is possible to give a list of several voice numbers: The rule will then <br>
be applied to every voice in the list (independant of each other).<br>
<br>
&lt;input-mode&gt; determines what type of variables the rule will receive in <br>
its inputs:<br>
 - rhythm/pitch: The rule will receive rhythm-pitch pairs excluding (i.e. <br>
                 skipping) rests.<br>
 - include-rests: The rule will receive rhythm-pitch pairs including rests.<br>
 - rhythm/pitch-segment: For rules with one input, this setting is  <br>
                  identical to the rhythm/pitch setting. For rules with<br>
                  more than one input, the rule will receive consecutive<br>
                  pitch/rhythm pairs between rests. The rule does not<br>
                  check rhythm/pitch pairs that are divided by a rest. <br>
                  This setting is good for rules that are only valid <br>
                  within a phrase.<br>
 - rhythm/time/pitch: The rule will receive rhythm-pitch pairs excluding (i.e. <br>
                 skipping) rests including the inormation about the<br>
                 absolute onset time:<br>
                 Format '(duration timepoint pitch)<br>
 - rhythm/pitch-list-ALL: The rule receives a list with all duration-pitch<br>
                  pair up to the point where the rule is checked. Rests are <br>
                  included in the list. The rule should only have one input.<br>
				  <br>
*** NOT SUPPORTED **********************************<br>
&lt;gracenotes?&gt; gives the option to leave out grace notes when checking the <br>
rule:<br>
 - normal: Grace notes are included and checked by the rule. Note: if <br>
           grace notes are not used in the domain, this setting will create <br>
           faster rules.<br>
 - exclude-gracenotes: Grace notes are removed and not seen by the rule.<br>
***************************************************************************<br>
<br>
[Backtracking: By default this rule will trigger backtracking in its own <br>
               engine. If this is not possible, it will trigger backtracking <br>
               in the other engine.]<br>
<br>
Optional inputs:<br>
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch <br>
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that <br>
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule <br>
is true, the weight (given in the &lt;weight&gt; input) is passed to the engine. <br>
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a <br>
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false <br>
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it <br>
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the <br>
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the <br>
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. <br>
<br>
Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the <br>
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending<br>
on the candidate).<br>
