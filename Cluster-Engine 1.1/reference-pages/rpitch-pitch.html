Rule that accesses simultaneous pitches in 2 or more voices. <br>
<br>
&lt;rule&gt; is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the <br>
function has to be either true or false. Each input will receive a list <br>
with simultaneous pitches (optional with duration and offsets). If the <br>
rule has more than one input it will receive information for consecutive <br>
events (the positions of the events are determined by the input-mode <br>
setting).<br>
<br>
&lt;list-of-voices&gt; is a list with the numbers of the voices (starting at 0) that <br>
the rule accesses. Any number of voices can be accessed by the rule. It is also <br>
possible to give a list of lists of voices: all sublists will generate a <br>
separate rule. All voices must have a pitch and rhythm domain. For efficiency <br>
reasons it is advised to rather split the rule into several simpler rules <br>
(that only access a few number of voices) if possible. This will make it <br>
possible to find failed candidates sooner, and to be more precise about what <br>
caused backtracking.<br>
<br>
&lt;timepoints&gt;  This input is only considered if the input-mode is <br>
              at-timepoints. This is a list of absolute timepoints <br>
              (starting at 0) where the rue will be checked. <br>
              Ex. (0 5/4 9/4)<br>
<br>
&lt;input-mode&gt; sets at what time points the rule will be checked. <br>
 - all:        The rule will be checked at every harmonic slice.<br>
               Every time any voice has a new note event, the rule<br>
               will be checked.<br>
- beat:        The rule will be checked at metric beats.<br>
- 1st-beat:    The rule will be checked at the first [down] beat<br>
               in every measure.<br>
- 1st-voice:   The rule will be checked at the onset of every new note <br>
               in the first voice in the list-of-voices.<br>
- at-timepoints:  The rule will be checked at the timepoints in the <br>
               timepoints input.<br>
<br>
*** NOT SUPPORTED ********************************************************<br>
&lt;gracenotes?&gt;  <br>
- exclude-gracenotes:    Pitches that relate to grace notes will be ignored.<br>
- normal:  Grace notes are also checked by the rule:<br>
               they are related to the regular notes in the other<br>
               voices.<br>
***********************************************************************************<br>
               <br>
&lt;format&gt; sets the format an input on the abstraction will receive. Note<br>
that rests will be indicated as nil (without the specification of teh exact <br>
duration of the rest).<br>
- pitch:       Each input receives a list with simultaneous pitches.<br>
               Each pitch belongs to the corresponding voice indicated <br>
               in the &lt;list-voices&gt; input. Ex. '(67 60)<br>
- p_d_offs:    Each input receives a list of lists. Each sublist represent <br>
               a corresponding voice indicated in the &lt;list-voices&gt; input.<br>
               A sublist contains the information about an events pitch, <br>
               duration and offset between the events onset and the time<br>
               point the rule was checked (this is determined by the<br>
               &lt;input-mode&gt; setting). Offsets are either 0 or a negative <br>
               distance. Ex. '((67 1/4 0) (60 1/4 -1/8)).<br>
- p_d_offs+timepoint: Each input receives a list of lists. Each sublist  <br>
               represent a corresponding voice indicated in the &lt;list-voices&gt; <br>
               input. In addition, the time point for when the rule is <br>
               checked is added as a final value (note that this value <br>
               is not in a sublist). A sublist contains the information <br>
               about an events pitch, duration and offset between the <br>
               events onset and the time point the rule was checked (this <br>
               is determined by the &lt;input-mode&gt; setting). Offsets are <br>
               either 0 or a negative distance. <br>
               Ex. '((67 1/4 0) (60 1/4 -1/8) 5/4).<br>
<br>
list-all-voices can include any number of voices. All voices must have a pitch <br>
and rhythm domain.<br>
<br>
DO NOT use this rule to restrict rests in relation to other rests: use instead<br>
the r-rhythm-rhythm.<br>
<br>
Optional inputs:<br>
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch <br>
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that <br>
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule <br>
is true, the weight (given in the &lt;weight&gt; input) is passed to the engine. <br>
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a <br>
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false <br>
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it <br>
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the <br>
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the <br>
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. <br>
<br>
Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the <br>
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending<br>
on the candidate).<br>
