All voices share the same sequences of time signatures. The metric domain is a list of allowed time signatures, for example '((4 4)(3 4)). If the metric domain is empty, it is assumed that the time signature is 4//4 (non-metric notation is not possible in the system). It is also possible to define how the metric structure interact with some rules in more details by using the metricdomain function (see further on in this tutorial).$$Each following row has two inputs, which are the rhythm and pitch domains for one voice.$$rhythmdomain: A voice needs at least one duration value in its rhythm domain. Candidates in a rhythm domain can either be single note values or durations grouped into motifs (see further on in this tutorial).$$pitchdomain: Candidates in a pitch domain can either be single pitches, pitches grouped into motifs or melodic profiles (see further on in this tutorial). If a user wants to only search for a sequence of pitches, a single duration (for example a whole note) should be given as a rhythm domain.$$Note that a domain with only one candidate does not trigger a search, since it gives no choices for the system. Engines with one-candidate domains will never backtrack and thus not $slow down the search in the other engines. At least one engine will have to have a domain with more than one candidate to make the box output a score.$$The cluster-engine function can be expanded to support up to 10 voices (this is only a graphic limitation, and can in principle be increased).$$The system will stop after 1,000,000 loops even if no solution was found (this can be increased).

Using heuristic rules (see further on in this tutorial) may remove $the effect of this setting. $debug?: This is a flag that is either true or false.
